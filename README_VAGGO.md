In case to deploy camunda elements i think that the only way (i am looking for other) is to install camunda modeler in our new machine. 
Camunda modeler read elements from project directory deploy them. 

Any Idea about?

I tried to install camunda modeler in the new machinve via : wget "https://camunda.com/download/modeler/camunda-modeler-5.17.0-linux-x64.tar.gz". But the response is 404.
